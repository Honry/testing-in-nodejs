# Testing in Nodejs

The original source code is cheated from
[Node.js Recipes](http://www.apress.com/9781430260585).

The full text for the sample code is [Chapter 11 Testing in
Node.js](http://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4302-6059-2_11/fulltext.html).

Many thanks to the author Cory Gackenheimer and the publisher Apress.

Here I just want to try the sample code for self study.

## My problems

Need to test some Node.js based JavaScript APIs on a platform without `npm`
support. Thus need to figure out:

* which testing framework is suitable, and
* how to enable the framework on the platform.
